# Introduction
The central theme of this project will be to assess the morphological and allometric differences between ecomorphs within the genus Anolis. The term ecomorph describes a group of species, perhaps not sharing a most recent common ancestor, with a similar ecological niche and behavior within the context of this niche. In order to assess the differences between these ecomorphs, we will be conducting the following analyses:

1. Visualize how hind limb length varies with size (i.e., allometry!).
2. Visualize and asses how hind limb length vs. size relationship covary with ecological niche.
3. Learn more complex operations in ggplot than weâ€™ve undertaken so far.
4.  Evaluate this hindlimb-size relationship using standard frequentist models within and without a phylogenetic context.
5. Using an information theory approach, assess the fit of phylogenetically corrected models of hind-limb variation under different modes of character evolution.

# Methods
Briefly outline the specifics of how the question will be answered.
The sets of data on anole lizards were taken from @hagey2017there and log transformed ultimately to form two linear models that represented the effect of perch height and diameter on hindlimb length. The residuals from these plots were mutated into a tibble and plotted against the discrete factors to see the visual effect of height and perch diameter on hindlimb-SVL relationship. Then, using the anole phylogenetic tree created by data from @poe2017phylogenetic, phylogenetic least squares models of hindlimb-SVL relationships were manufactured featuring all unique combinations of these two covariates: 
  
### Loading the data
```{r, "load the data"}
anole <- read_csv("anole.dat.csv")
anole.eco <- read_csv("anole.eco.csv")
anole.tree <- read.tree("anole.tre")
```

### Cleaning and Merging the Data Sets
```{r, "join, filter, mutate to log"}
anole2 <- anole%>%
left_join(anole.eco)%>%
  filter(!Ecomorph%in%c("U","CH"))%>%
  na.omit()

anole.log <- anole2%>%
  mutate_at(c("SVL", "HTotal","PH","ArbPD"),log)
```

### Creating PGLS Models
```{r, "PGLS models"}
### phylogenetic GLS models

#PGLS under BM, no ecomorph
pgls.BM1 <- gls(HTotal ~SVL, correlation = corBrownian(1,phy = anole.tree,form=~Species),data = anole.log, method = "ML")

#PGLS under BM, w ecomorph
pgls.BM2 <- gls(HTotal ~SVL * Ecomorph2, correlation = corBrownian(1,phy = anole.tree,form=~Species),data = anole.log, method = "ML")

#PGLS under OU, no ecomorph
pgls.OU1 <- gls(HTotal ~SVL, correlation = corMartins(0,phy = anole.tree,form=~Species),data = anole.log, method = "ML")

#PGLS under OU, w, ecomorph
pgls.OU2 <- gls(HTotal ~SVL * Ecomorph2, correlation = corMartins(0,phy = anole.tree,form=~Species),data = anole.log, method = "ML")
```

### An altered "AIC" chunk that  produces a table of AIC values with kable, a descriptive caption, and row names for data clarication.

```{r, "AIC"}
#AIC operations
anole.phylo.aic <- AICc(pgls.BM1,pgls.BM2,pgls.OU1,pgls.OU2)
anole.phylow.aicw <- aicw(anole.phylo.aic$AICc) 

print(anole.phylow.aicw)
rownames <- rownames(anole.phylow.aicw)
print(rownames)
rownames(anole.phylow.aicw) <- c('PGLS under BM and no ecomorph', 'PGLS under BM with ecomorph', 'PGLS under OU with no ecomorph', 'PGLS under OU with ecomorph')

# Descriptive caption for "AIC" chunk
anole.phylow.aicw %>% 
  kable(caption = "This table displays AIC values with kable allows for a comparison of ecomorph 
model fits using Akaike Information Criterion.")
```

### Accounting for Standard Error in Data Through The creation of Residuals
```{r, "add residuals"}
#add phylo-corrected residuals
anole.log <- anole.log%>%
  mutate(phylo.res=residuals(pgls.BM2))
```

### Plot of Snout-Vent Length Against Mean Total Hind-Limb Length, Color Coded by Ecomorph
```{r, "HTotal vs SVL", fig.cap="Mean snout-vent length plotted against mean total hind-limb length, color-coded by ecomorph"}
anole.log%>%
  ggplot(aes(HTotal,SVL,col=Ecomorph2))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method="lm")
```
  
### Regression plot of log-transformed HTotal vs SVL with points colored by Ecomorph2 (with a descriptive caption).
```{r}
print(anole)
anole.log.plot <- anole%>%
  left_join(anole.eco)%>%
  filter(!Ecomorph%in%c("U","CH"))%>%
  na.omit()%>%
  mutate_at(c("HTotal"),log)%>%
  rename("log_HTotal" = "HTotal") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=log_HTotal, y=SVL, col=Ecomorph2))+geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")

print(anole.log.plot)
  
```
# Descriptive caption for regresssion plot 
  kable(caption = "This figure displays the regression plot of log-transformed HTotal vs SVL with points colored by Ecomorph2.")
  
### Plot of Phylogenetically Corrected Hindlimb Residuals Against Anole Ecomorph
```{r,"plot residuals", fig.cap="Boxplot of phylogenetically corrected hindlimb residuals versus anole ecomorph"}

p.eco.phylo <- anole.log %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Ecomorph2,y=phylo.res)) +geom_boxplot() +stat_summary(fun=mean, geom="point", size=3)

print(p.eco.phylo)
```

# Results
Briefly summarize the results.
Results from Ecomorph2 allow us to determine there is a correlation between HTotal and SVL. There are differences within each anole ecomorph with crown-giant showing the greatest correlation of HTotal and SVL compared to the other species studied. 
  
# Discussion
Briefly discuss the importance of the results (i.e., how they relate to the main question).
Importance of the results further show there are significant ways to show the morphological and allometric differences among ecomorphs. There exists different relationships, including correlation among different lengths between snout-vent/hind-limb length that can be studied and evaluated to understand evolution. There are multiple variations within different species that can be concluded which further allow for the correlating evaluation between size relationships, frequency, and evolution.
