# Introduction
The central theme of this project will be to assess morphological differences within a genus in relation to ecomorph, or a group of species that does not share a most recent common ancestor but has a similar ecological niche and behavior within the context of this niche. This project will specifically examine the snout-vent length (SVL)-hindlimb relationship within the Anolis genus and poses the question: does this relationship vary with ecomorph? The potential significance of ecomorph in this relationship is important to study as it displays a niche of evolution that relies on environment rather than phylogeny. This project will explore this question through the use of regression models and evaluation of model fit.

# Methods
The sets of data on anole lizards were taken from @hagey2017there (omitting any rows with missing values) and log transformed. Using the anole phylogenetic tree created by data from @poe2017phylogenetic, four phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) models were created for the mean total hindlimb length (Htotal)-SVL relationship: two using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model and two using the Brownian motion (BM) model; for each model type, there is one simple regression model that does not include ecomorph and one model that does. The fit of these models were then compared utilizing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC); these fits were also visualized with various graphs, including the residuals of each model.
  
### Loading the Data
```{r, "load the data"}
anole <- read_csv("anole.dat.csv")
anole.eco <- read_csv("anole.eco.csv")
anole.tree <- read.tree("anole.tre")
```

### Cleaning and Merging the Data Sets
```{r, "join, filter, mutate to log"}
anole2 <- anole%>%
left_join(anole.eco)%>%
  filter(!Ecomorph%in%c("U","CH"))%>%
  na.omit()

anole.log <- anole2%>%
  mutate_at(c("SVL", "HTotal","PH","ArbPD"),log)
```

### Creating PGLS Models
```{r, "PGLS models"}
### phylogenetic GLS models

#PGLS under BM, no ecomorph
pgls.BM1 <- gls(HTotal ~SVL, correlation = corBrownian(1,phy = anole.tree,form=~Species),data = anole.log, method = "ML")

#PGLS under BM, w ecomorph
pgls.BM2 <- gls(HTotal ~SVL * Ecomorph2, correlation = corBrownian(1,phy = anole.tree,form=~Species),data = anole.log, method = "ML")

#PGLS under OU, no ecomorph
pgls.OU1 <- gls(HTotal ~SVL, correlation = corMartins(0,phy = anole.tree,form=~Species),data = anole.log, method = "ML")

#PGLS under OU, w ecomorph
pgls.OU2 <- gls(HTotal ~SVL * Ecomorph2, correlation = corMartins(0,phy = anole.tree,form=~Species),data = anole.log, method = "ML")
```

### Determining Model Fits with AIC
```{r, "AIC"}
#AIC operations
anole.phylo.aic <- AICc(pgls.BM1,pgls.BM2,pgls.OU1,pgls.OU2)
anole.phylow.aicw <- aicw(anole.phylo.aic$AICc) 
rownames <- rownames(anole.phylow.aicw) 
rownames(anole.phylow.aicw) <- c('PGLS under BM and no ecomorph', 'PGLS under BM with ecomorph', 'PGLS under OU with no ecomorph', 'PGLS under OU with ecomorph')

# Descriptive caption for "AIC" table
anole.phylow.aicw %>% 
  kable(caption = "This table displays AIC values, allowing for a comparison of the fit of each PGLS model using the Akaike Information Criterion.")
```

### Adding Residuals
```{r, "add residuals"}
#add phylo-corrected residuals
anole.log <- anole.log%>%
  mutate(phylo.res=residuals(pgls.BM2))
```

### Plotting SVL Against Mean Total Hind-Limb Length
```{r, "HTotal vs SVL", fig.cap="Mean snout-vent length plotted against mean total hind-limb length, color-coded by ecomorph"}
anole.log%>%
  ggplot(aes(HTotal,SVL,col=Ecomorph2))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method="lm")
```
  
### Regression Plot of Log-Transformed HTotal vs SVL
```{r, "Regression plot", fig.cap="This figure displays the regression plot of log-transformed HTotal vs SVL with points colored by Ecomorph2"}
print(anole)
anole.log.plot <- anole%>%
  left_join(anole.eco)%>%
  filter(!Ecomorph%in%c("U","CH"))%>%
  na.omit()%>%
  mutate_at(c("HTotal"),log)%>%
  rename("log_HTotal" = "HTotal")%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=log_HTotal, y=SVL, col=Ecomorph2))+geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")

print(anole.log.plot)
  
```

### Plot of Phylogenetically Corrected Hindlimb Residuals Against Anole Ecomorph
```{r,"plot residuals", fig.cap="Boxplot of phylogenetically corrected hindlimb residuals versus anole ecomorph"}

p.eco.phylo <- anole.log %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Ecomorph2,y=phylo.res)) +geom_boxplot() +stat_summary(fun=mean, geom="point", size=3)

print(p.eco.phylo)
```

# Results
The comparison of the data allows us to determine the differences among species and how different sizes and variations play a role upon evolution. Visualizing the data shows a correlation between HTotal and SVL. Of the PGLS models created, the PGLS under Brownian motion with ecomorph had the best fit (lowest fit score under AIC), meaning that ecomorph is a significant predictor of the hindlimb-SVL relationship. The significance of the ecomorph factor also varies between each anole species. However, the significance of ecomorph decreases when the data is corrected for phylogeny.


# Discussion
The SVL-hindlimb relationship within the Anolis genus can be significantly predicted by ecomorph. These results importantly display a unique type of evolution that can occur not phylogenetically, but rather in relation to environment and ecological niches. While the strength of the ecomorph factor decreases when phylogeny is considered, it will be important to study this niche of evolution through more relationships and genera in the future.
