# R Markdown

# Header 1

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

![] tells R to break from R code and use html code (or whatever code you tell R to use). When using this to imbed an image though, make 
sure that you are using the image address from online. If you imbed an image from your native hard-drive, it will not show up when we submit 
it to professor kenaley.
